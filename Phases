Project Details:
Our Travel Agency Website is a PHP and MySQL-based project designed to provide users with an interactive platform for exploring tourism packages, making inquiries, and managing content through an admin dashboard. The website ensures a user-friendly experience while maintaining dynamic content retrieval and database integration.
This document outlines the main components, team responsibilities, and functionality of the website, explaining how different modules work together.

Project Title: Travel Agency Website
        
Problem Statement:
Many small tourism agencies lack a robust online platform to showcase their services, handle user inquiries, and manage dynamic content. As a result, agencies struggle to reach a wider audience, provide up-to-date information, and effectively compete in the rapidly growing travel market.

Solution Proposed:
Our proposed solution is a feature-rich, PHP-and-MySQL-based tourism website. It provides an intuitive interface for customers to browse travel packages, submit inquiries, and view category-based services. An admin panel allows authorized personnel to update packages, manage categories, and monitor user inquiries in real-time.

Project Scope:
Aim: To build a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that seamlessly connects travelers with curated travel packages and services, while enabling the agency to manage content with minimal effort.
Main Objectives:
•	Implement dynamic content retrieval for travel packages, categories, and subcategories.
•	Provide a secure login and dashboard for admin management.
•	Offer an interactive user experience via sliders, search functionality, and user inquiries.
•	Ensure responsive design and accessibility for diverse devices and users.
•	Maintain database efficiency for scalability.

Application Description:
The Travel Agency Website offers an engaging homepage with featured packages, promotional sliders, and category overviews. Users can browse or filter packages, view detailed itineraries, and submit inquiries for more information. An admin dashboard facilitates the addition, deletion, or modification of travel packages and categories in real-time. Features include:
•	Dynamic Homepage: Showcases featured tours and promotional banners.
•	Interactive Slider: Displays images of popular destinations.
•	Category & Subcategory System: Organizes travel packages by region or type.
•	Inquiry Form: Captures user details, interests, and questions, storing them for admin review.
•	Admin Dashboard: Allows administrators to log in securely to manage packages, categories, and user inquiries.
•	Database Integration: Stores package details, categories, user credentials, and inquiries for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

PHASE 2
User Requirements and Application Specifications:

1. Chosen Development Model

Chosen Model: Agile Development
Justification: Agile is chosen due to its flexibility and iterative approach, allowing continuous improvements based on user feedback. Given that the project involves a database-driven application with multiple stakeholders (users, admins, and clients), Agile ensures that evolving requirements can be integrated efficiently without disrupting the overall development process.


2. User Requirements

a. Stakeholders
End-Users: Individuals who browse and inquire about packages. They need a simple and intuitive interface for navigation and inquiries.
Administrators: Manage packages, categories, subcategories, and user inquiries. Their role is to update, modify, and ensure database integrity.
Developers: Responsible for building and maintaining the system, ensuring functionality, security, and performance.
Clients (Businesses): May list their travel packages on the platform, requiring a structured approach to pricing, categorization, and customer interaction.

b. User Stories
	•	User Type: Visitor
Story: 'As a visitor, I want to browse available packages by category and subcategory so that I can quickly find relevant travel options.
Benefit: Enhances user experience and increases engagement.'
	•	User Type: Registered User
Story: 'As a registered user, I want to send inquiries about packages so that I can receive more details from the administrator.
Benefit: Provides a structured way to communicate with the system and receive responses.'
	•	User Type: Administrator
Story: 'As an administrator, I want to manage package details, categories, and inquiries so that the system remains up-to-date.
